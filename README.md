# Penn-Scrape

As a first-year student at Penn State, I wanted to get involved and attend as many engineering events as possible.

Naturally, I went to the [engineering events page](https://engr.psu.edu/events/index.aspx) and started manually adding each event to my calendar.

However, this quickly became tedious and time-consuming.

I thought to myself, "There has to be a way to automate this process..."

A few Google searches and [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lSq2IDrA6vpZEV92AmQfJK) later, I started to build an original web scraper that extract events and relevant data from my school's events page.

Additionally, my code converts this data into a .ics file (calendar file) that is automatically put into my personal calendar, saving time and making event tracking much easier.

Methods Learned: HTML Parsing and Processing, Data Extraction, File Generation, Automation

Tools Used: Python, HTML, [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), [Firecrawl (YC S22)](https://www.firecrawl.dev/)
