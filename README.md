# web-scraper

As a first-year student at Penn State, I wanted to get involved and attend as many engineering events as possible.

Naturally, I went to the engineering events page and started manually adding each event to my calendar.

However, this quickly became tedious and time-consuming.

I thought to myself, "There has to be a way to automate this process..."

A few Google searches and YouTube videos later, I started to build an original web scraper that extract events and relevant data from my school's events page.

Additionally, my code converts this data into a .ics file (calendar file) that is automatically put into my personal calendar, saving time and making event tracking much easier.
